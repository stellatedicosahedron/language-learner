First time setup:

It's encouraged you set up a virtual environment for this project. This will allow you to isolate all the project's dependencies. To do this, go to the backend directory and run

```
python -m venv venv
```

Which will create the virtual environment. Then, in order to activate the virtual environment, enter

```
venv\Scripts\activate
```

Whenever you want to deactivate the virtual environment, you can simply enter "deactivate" into the console.

Then, with the virtual environment activated, you can download the project dependencies:

```
pip install django
pip install djangorestframework
```

Please don't hesitate to ask any questions about the first time setup, it can be pretty annoying
